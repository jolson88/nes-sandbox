# nes-sandbox
A sandbox to learn NES programming

## Development Tools
- cc65 compiler/assembly pipeline

## Resources
The initial steps of this repo are a hybrid of rainwarrior's [example](https://github.com/bbbradsmith/NES-ca65-example) and following along the [Nerdy Nights](http://nintendoage.com/pub/faq/NA/index.html?load=nerdy_nights_out.html#) tutorials.

There is also [this list](http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/User:Tepples/tutorial) that has ideas for projects when programming NES. That project was licensed under MIT License, so this one is as well.

## Acknowledgements
Much of the initial organization and structure of the code is taken from [depp's NES Homebrew Game](https://github.com/depp/ctnes).
